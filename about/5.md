# Why Authtrail

The dawn of open-source and decentralized technologies has inspired the creation of systems that give individuals more power to exchange assets and open up new business opportunities while reducing reliance on centralized authorities. However, even though the pace of technological progress has been outstanding, the adoption of decentralized solutions still awaits implementation in the real economy on a large scale.

Polkadot, one of the leading players in the Web3 ecosystem, holds an incredible potential to transform the way businesses, individuals, and organizations manage assets and data. Still, several factors hinder the broader adoption of Web3 solutions:

* Developers need to overcome a high barrier to entry and master loads of complex technical requirements.
* Investment in Web3 development takes tons of resources, besides, it’s hard to find the right person/people to navigate the lengthy process and deliver satisfactory results.
* Price-performance ratio of Web3 solutions is often seen as unfavorable, as many businesses and users find them unconvincing, even risky, when it comes to providing value in the real economy.

Authtrail is a managed service provider for developers and businesses building on Web3. With Authtrail’s unified gateway that provides access to Polkadot parachains simply through APIs, they can create a working Web3-based product from day one. Building with Authtrail does not require prior knowledge of blockchain technology and the hassle of lengthy testing and auditing, which substantially reduces the go-to-market timeline and resources spent in the process.

Authtrail brings the power of distributed technologies to the average web developer and opens the floodgate to their widespread adoption. It democratizes the usability of advanced technologies and helps the Web3 services reach wider and deeper.
